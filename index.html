          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>What is the Running Plan Generator?</h3>
            <p>The Running Plan Generator is a tool to help you create a running training plan. It will generate a plan
              for you based on the distance you wish to run, and the number of weeks you have to train.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How is this any different to other plans I see on the internet?</h3>
            <p>With other plans, everyone gets the exact same plan. With the running plan generator, you get a new plan each time you hit the generate button.</p>
            <p>Also, most other plans stipulate how long you have to train for - 12 weeks, 16 weeks, etc. But it's often the case where you see a race you want to enter but it's an odd number of weeks away, such as 17 weeks. For this eventually, we've got you covered.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I get my training plan?</h3>
            <p>Once you have paid for the Running Plan Generator, you will be able to generate your training plans. Simply, come back here, click the login button, and enter the email address you used when purchasing the generator.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How long can I use the generator for?</h3>
            <p>You can generate as many running plans as you want for 2 weeks from the date of purchase. After that, any saved plans will remain on your computer, but you will not be able to create new ones.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I save my plan?</h3>
            <p>You can save one plan for each distance - 5km, 10km, half-marathon, marathon.</p>
            <p>Notes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The plans are saved on the device you generate it. For example, if you are in work and save a plan on your computer, it will only be available as a saved plan on that computer. You can, however, save another plan on another computer if you wish.</li>
                <li>If you clear your "Site Data" in your browser, this will remove those plans. For this reason, it is important that you copy it to a document or spreadsheet (and, preferably, print it out).</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I edit my plan?</h3>
            <p>The plan is not editable, but you can generate a new one if you wish. Once you copy the contents of your plan to a document or spreadsheet, you can then edit it as much as you like.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I print my plan?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can print your plan by clicking on the "Print" button. You will not see this button until you have completed a purchase and logged in.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Why is there no pace for each run?</h3>
            <p>We have created this running plan generator to plan your runs, but not how fast you should run for each. Each person has different goals, and should set their pace accordingly.</p>
            <p>If you are aiming to run a sub 20-minute 5k, we'd suggest your intervals are at a pace of less than 4 minutes per km. If you wish to run a marathon in under 4 hours, we suggest your intervals will be less than 5 minutes per km. And so on ...</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>What about if I train by heartrate rather than pace?</h3>
            <p>We have taken the same approach to heartrate running as pace running. Easy runs and longs runs should be in Zone 2, endurance runs will be zones 3 to 4, and intervals will be zone 4 to 5. However, it's up to you to be as flexible or strict as you wish.</p>
